# Linear Regression Model: House Price Predictions

## Problem Statement

- We have a dataset that contains information about house prices in a given city.
- We want to build a linear regression model that can predict the price of a house based on its characteristics.
- We also want to evaluate the performance of our model.

## Steps to Solve the Problem

- The train folder contains data.xlsx, which contains the training data, and train.ipynb, which contains my solution code.

- The test result is saved in the linear_regression_model.joblib file in the data folder.

- The model testing is done with Flask.
